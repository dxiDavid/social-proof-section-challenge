## Overview

This challenge was fun and easy to do. The only tricky part was to get the elements aligned in steps like the design. I tried to use a combination of flexbox and auto margins but that did nothing so I used transforms and relative positioning instead, and it turned out great. 

The page is responsive, I finally learned how to position backround images correctly and explored the svg format. There's alot that I still need to know but I like the fact that you can do so much with svgs that you can't do with other formats.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

## My process

I started by structuring the content in HTML then moved on to positioning everything where it should be (relatively speaking) without any styles.

Next i set the font styles and sizes and added the background image. I slightly increased the opacity of the svgs to see them a little bit better when positioning. 

Once that was done, I refined the styles so I could get as close to the design as possible. I appreciate the fact that the project assets were already optimized to fit the design so they were easy to work with. 

After I was happy with how everrything looked, I proceed to make it look good on mobile with two media queries and It was pretty much done.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I looked into positioning elements with margins though I didn't end up using them. I also learned how to debug CSS by setting an solid coloured outline on every element or a very soft background (if needed). 

```css
*{
  outline: 2px solid rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.281);
}
```

I wish I knew this sooner since it would have saved me hours of debbuging on previous challenges but oh wellðŸ˜‚

### Continued development

I used flexbox on this and once I learn grid, I'm definitely going to try it out with this challenge.
